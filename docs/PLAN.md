## Enhancement Roadmap

### Tier 1: High Impact, Low Effort

#### Output Style Variations

| Style | Personality | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Vesper** | Sophisticated British wit | General work (exists) |
| **Spartan** | Minimal, bullet-points only | Quick tasks |
| **Mentor** | Patient, educational | Learning, onboarding |
| **Executive** | High-level summaries | Non-technical stakeholders |

#### Rules Expansion

| Rule | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `cli-tools.md` | Modern CLI preferences | Done |
| `thinking.md` | Extended thinking triggers | Done |
| `commit-style.md` | Conventional commits format | Done |
| `naming-conventions.md` | Component naming patterns | Done |
| `code-review.md` | Review checklist | Future |
| `testing-philosophy.md` | Coverage expectations | Future |

#### Hook Implementations

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pre-commit-lint.sh` | Run linter before committing |
| `post-edit-format.sh` | Auto-format after edits |
| `dangerous-cmd-warn.sh` | Confirm destructive commands |

### Tier 2: High Impact, Medium Effort

#### Agent Gaps

| Agent | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| `docker-expert` | Containerisation is ubiquitous |
| `github-actions-expert` | CI/CD complexity |
| `nextjs-expert` | App Router specifics |
| `testing-architect` | Strategy decisions |
| `api-design-expert` | OpenAPI, versioning |

#### Skill Gaps

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `debug` | Systematic debugging workflow |
| `migrate` | Framework/version upgrades |
| `refactor` | Safe refactoring |
| `secure` | Security audit checklist |

#### Skill Parity

Languages needing Python-level depth:
- `typescript-patterns/`
- `go-patterns/`
- `rust-patterns/`

### Tier 3: Strategic Expansions

- **Template System**: Project scaffolding via `/scaffold`
- **MCP Server Catalog**: Curated high-value servers
- **Feedback System**: Track tool effectiveness

            +-----------+-----------+
```

## Immediate Next Steps

### Command-to-Skill Consolidation (Complete)

Most commands have been converted to skills for better discovery and on-demand loading. See `docs/COMMAND-SKILL-PATTERN.md`.

**Completed conversions:**
- [x] `/testgen` → `skills/testgen/`
- [x] `/review` → `skills/review/`
- [x] `/explain` → `skills/explain/`
- [x] `/spawn` → `skills/spawn/`
- [x] `/atomise` → `skills/atomise/`
- [x] `/setperms` → `skills/setperms/`
- [x] `/introspect` → `skills/introspect/`

**Remaining as commands:**
- `/sync` - Session bootstrap (paired with /save)
- `/save` - Session persistence (paired with /sync)

### Planned Work

- [x] Create `rules/commit-style.md`
- [x] Create `rules/naming-conventions.md`
- [x] Create Spartan output style
- [x] Create Mentor output style
- [x] Create Executive output style
- [x] Add `debug-ops` skill (systematic debugging workflow)
- [x] Add 3 hook implementations (lint, format, safety)
- [x] Add `migrate-ops` skill (framework/language upgrades)
- [x] Add `refactor-ops` skill (safe refactoring patterns)
- [x] Add `scaffold` skill (project scaffolding)
- [x] Add `perf-ops` skill (performance profiling)
- [x] Add `log-ops` skill (JSONL/log analysis)
- [ ] Add docker-expert agent
- [ ] Install lnav on Windows for log analysis

## Open Questions

- Should agents auto-update from a central registry?
- How to handle agent versioning?
- Should there be a "recommended agents" list per project type?

## Guiding Principle

> The best enhancements solve problems you've already felt. Follow the pain.
