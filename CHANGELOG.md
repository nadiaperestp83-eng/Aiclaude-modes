## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- **11 language/framework expert agents** deprecated in favour of their `-ops`
  skill twins (python, typescript, javascript, go, rust, react, vue, astro,
  laravel, sql, postgres) - unique agent content folded into the skills;
  dispatching skills (review, testgen, explain, perf-ops, security-ops) now
  route `general-purpose` agents with skill preloading. 23 → 12 agents.
- `claude-code-debug`, `claude-code-headless`, `claude-code-hooks` skills -
  merged into `claude-code-internals` (content was written against Claude Code
  ~2.0; the stale `$TOOL_INPUT` hook contract is gone, stdin JSON is current)

### Added
- **`claude-api-ops` skill** - building ON Claude: Messages API, tool use,
  prompt caching, structured outputs (`output_config.format`), batches,
  extended thinking, model selection, Agent SDK (Python + TypeScript)
- **`playwright-ops` skill** - e2e testing: selector hierarchy, fixtures/POM,
  network mocking, auth storageState, CI sharding, flake hunting, config template
- **`terraform-ops` skill** - Terraform/OpenTofu IaC: state management,
  module patterns, OIDC CI/CD workflow template, drift detection, write-only
  secrets, native `terraform test`
- **`claude-code-internals` skill** - merges + refreshes claude-code-debug,
  claude-code-headless, claude-code-hooks against current docs: 30-event hook
  catalog with JSON contracts, current skill frontmatter spec, headless/CLI
  reference, extension debugging decision trees
- CI: doc-drift gate (`tests/doc-drift.sh`) - docs must match disk
- CI: skill behavioural test suites (`tests/run-skill-tests.sh`)

### Changed
- README/AGENTS.md/PLAN.md reconciled with actual inventory (80 skills, 9 hooks,
  7 rules); ghost references removed (`rules/thinking.md`, `docs/DASH.md`)
- `tests/skills/functional/git-workflow.*` renamed to `git-cli-tools.*`
