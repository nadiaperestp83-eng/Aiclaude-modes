feature releases live in the README "Recent Updates" section.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`adr-ops` skill** - Architecture Decision Records as a cross-project workflow,
  generalized from a mature in-house ADR protocol: when-to-write / when-NOT
  decision rule, the canonical format (BLUF-first `## Decision`, fixed section
  order, frontmatter field set), the proposed→accepted→superseded/deprecated
  lifecycle, and append-only supersession discipline. Ships three tools to the
  Skill Resource Protocol - `adr-new.sh` (scaffold the next sequential ADR,
  atomic, no-clobber, `--apply-supersede` flips the old record), `adr-index.sh`
  (read-only index table from frontmatter), and `adr-lint.py` (validates required
  fields, status enum, numbering, section order, and cross-file supersession
  bidirectionality). 36-assertion offline self-test.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added (media stack)
- **`ytdlp-ops` skill** - yt-dlp as the media ACQUISITION layer feeding
  ffmpeg-ops: format selection doctrine (`-S` sort over `-f` filters, codec
  targeting that avoids post-download transcodes), `--download-sections`
  clip-at-download, audio-only STT extraction (`-x --audio-format opus` =
  stream copy), playlist + `--download-archive` incremental channel syncs
  (`--break-on-existing --lazy-playlist` cron pattern), cookies/auth
  (`--cookies-from-browser`, Chrome 127+ Windows caveat, ban avoidance),
  rate limiting/politeness, SponsorBlock mark-vs-remove, output-template
  conventions (`[%(id)s]`, byte-safe `.100B` truncation), subtitles-as-cheap-
  transcripts, remux-vs-recode doctrine, livestream/premiere capture
  (`--live-from-start`, `--wait-for-video`), batch dry-runs (`--print
  filename`), a beyond-YouTube note, and a failure-triage ladder (the
  nsig/403/429/geo classes incl. TLS-fingerprint blocks → `--impersonate`,
  and the EJS class: missing formats from no JS runtime → deno default /
  `--js-runtimes node` opt-in, surfaced by the verifier as a warning;
  "outdated yt-dlp" is the diagnosis for most). Completes the acquire →
  process chain with ffmpeg-ops. Ships a §7 staleness
  verifier (`check-ytdlp-version.sh`: `--offline` structural in PR CI;
  `--live` = installed version >60 days behind the latest GitHub release,
  a documented core flag vanished from `yt-dlp --help`, or smoke-extraction
  failure → exit 10, network unreachable → exit 7 advisory; wired into
  `tests/check-resources.sh` + `freshness.yml`). 6 references, 1 date-stamped
  preset asset, 28-assertion offline self-test (age logic exercised via test
  seams - no network in tests).
- **`ffmpeg-ops` skill** - probe-first ffmpeg/ffprobe operations: ~30-command
  cookbook with footgun table (seek/keyframe semantics, `yuv420p`+`faststart`,
  quoting, VFR), EDL-driven editing (edit-as-code: schema asset +
  `cut-from-edl.py`, dry-run by default), `.cube` LUT grading with
  human-picks-the-grade chooser (`gen-luts.py`), STT/Whisper prep + the
  transcript-JSON contract, silence/scene segmentation (`detect-segments.py`),
  VMAF/SSIM quality gates (`quality-compare.py`), two-pass loudnorm automation,
  hw-encoder proof-encoding (`capability-scan.sh` - listed ≠ working), chapter
  authoring from scene/silence detection (`make-chapters.py` - ffmetadata mux /
  YouTube description / WebVTT), probe `--doctor` triage (each hazard - VFR,
  HDR transfer, rotation, interlacing, non-yuv420p, moov-at-EOF - paired with
  its exact fix command, exit 10), target-size compression
  (`smart-compress.py` - computed two-pass bitrate, auto audio/downscale,
  size-verified), scrub-preview sprites + WebVTT thumbnail track
  (`make-sprites.py`), an error-decoder reference (cryptic message → cause →
  fix), and a §7 staleness verifier (`verify-commands.sh`, wired into PR CI +
  freshness). Color grading is a first-class wing: a ~40-recipe look catalog
  (film stocks incl. CineStill halation as a verified composite, signature
  movie grades, era/genre moods, Sin City `colorhold`) with per-look scope
  checks and failure modes, an 18-variant mono/duo/tritone tone-map family
  (chroma = stop distance from the grey axis), the Hald-CLUT
  grade-anywhere→LUT workflow, a scope-matching ladder with its governing
  rule (transfer the chroma fingerprint globally; match key per scene-type,
  never the global mean) and a real-footage worked extraction (`grimdark`),
  plus a skin-tone equity caveat verified on the Kodak test portraits.
  `gen-luts.py` carries 32 parametric looks (channel-mix + 2/3-stop gradient
  maps). 19 references, 3 assets, 107-assertion self-test with
  lavfi-synthesized fixtures (no binary fixtures in repo).

### Fixed (media stack)
- **`ffmpeg-ops/cut-from-edl.py`** (found by real-media E2E):
  the output directory was created *after* ffmpeg opened the temp output, so
  any `-o` into a not-yet-existing directory died with a cryptic
  "Error opening output files"; and CLI `-o` resolved against the EDL's
  directory instead of the CWD (`-o work/final.mp4` with the EDL in `work/`
  silently meant `work/work/final.mp4`). `-o` is now CWD-relative (the EDL's
  own `output` field stays EDL-relative per the schema), and the destination
  dir is created before the concat runs.


### Added (skill resource protocol)
- **`docs/SKILL-RESOURCE-PROTOCOL.md`** - the build standard for skill `scripts/`,
  `assets/`, and `references/`: stream separation, semantic exit codes, `--help`
  with EXAMPLES, first-comment-block contract, `--json` envelopes, agent safety,
  the resource-scaffold checklist, and the **staleness-verifier pattern** (an
  `--offline` structural check that gates PR CI plus a `--live` drift check that
  runs scheduled, never blocking a PR on a network blip)
- Four verifier/scanner scripts built to the protocol:
  `claude-api-ops/check-model-table.py` (model+pricing table drift),
  `terraform-ops/check-action-refs.sh` (GitHub Action `uses:` refs resolve —
  catches the exact `trivy-action` tag bug from v3.0),
  `claude-code-ops/validate-hooks-json.py` (lint a hooks.json against the
  30-event catalog), `playwright-ops/triage-flakes.py` (rank flaky tests from a
  JSON report). Plus assets: `agentic-loop.py`, `output-schema.json`,
  `hooks.json.template`
- CI: `tests/check-resources.sh` runs the offline verifiers in PR CI;
  `.github/workflows/freshness.yml` runs the live drift checks weekly (advisory)

### Removed
- **20 expert agents** deprecated as part of the skills-first restructure
  (23 → 3 agents):
  - 11 language/framework experts → their `-ops` skill twins (python,
    typescript, javascript, go, rust, react, vue, astro, laravel, sql, postgres)
  - cypress-expert → `cypress-ops`; cloudflare-expert + wrangler-expert →
    `cloudflare-ops`; bash-expert → `bash-ops`; craftcms-expert → `craftcms-ops`;
    payloadcms-expert → `payloadcms-ops`; asus-router-expert → `asus-router-ops`
  - claude-architect → folded into `claude-code-ops`; aws-fargate-ecs-expert →
    folded into `container-orchestration`
  Per Anthropic's guidance, knowledge belongs in skills (progressive disclosure,
  single source of truth); subagents are reserved for context isolation. The
  only agents that remain are pure isolation/worker roles: `git-agent`,
  `firecrawl-expert`, `project-organizer`. Dispatching skills route
  `general-purpose` agents with skill preloading.
- `claude-code-debug`, `claude-code-headless`, `claude-code-hooks` skills -
  merged into `claude-code-ops` (content was written against Claude Code
  ~2.0; the stale `$TOOL_INPUT` hook contract is gone, stdin JSON is current)

### Added
- **`claude-api-ops` skill** - building ON Claude: Messages API, tool use,
  prompt caching, structured outputs (`output_config.format`), batches,
  extended thinking, model selection, Agent SDK (Python + TypeScript)
- **`playwright-ops` skill** - e2e testing: selector hierarchy, fixtures/POM,
  network mocking, auth storageState, CI sharding, flake hunting, config template
- **`terraform-ops` skill** - Terraform/OpenTofu IaC: state management,
  module patterns, OIDC CI/CD workflow template, drift detection, write-only
  secrets, native `terraform test`
- **`claude-code-ops` skill** - merges + refreshes claude-code-debug,
  claude-code-headless, claude-code-hooks against current docs: 30-event hook
  catalog with JSON contracts, current skill frontmatter spec, headless/CLI
  reference, extension debugging decision trees (+ extension-architecture from
  claude-architect)
- **`cypress-ops`, `cloudflare-ops`, `bash-ops` skills** - converted from the
  cypress/cloudflare/wrangler/bash agents and refreshed against current docs
  (Cypress `data-test`/Test Replay/cy.session; wrangler `deploy` not `publish`,
  jsonc config, Workers static assets; defensive bash to the resource protocol)
- **`craftcms-ops`, `payloadcms-ops`, `asus-router-ops` skills** - converted
  from the niche CMS/router agents and refreshed against current docs (Craft 5
  Matrix-as-entries; Payload 3 Next.js-native + Local API; Asuswrt-Merlin
  hardening + WireGuard)
- **Live security guard hooks**: `config-change-guard.sh` (ConfigChange event -
  scans edited Claude settings files for worm-persistence IOCs the moment
  they're written, reusing integrity-audit patterns) and `worktree-guard.sh`
  (PreToolUse - mechanically enforces `rules/worktree-boundaries.md`)
- **Plugin hook auto-wiring** (`hooks/hooks.json`) - plugin installs get the
  security-advisory hook set (pre-install-scan, manifest-dep-scan,
  session-start unicode scan, config-change guard, worktree guard) with zero
  hand-wiring; formatting/lint hooks stay opt-in examples
- **`fleet track`** command - register natively-spawned branches as fleet lanes
- New frontmatter on high-traffic skills: `when_to_use` (10 skills),
  `argument-hint` (iterate/review/testgen/explain), `effort: high`
  (iterate/review)
- README "Skill Description Budget" guidance - /doctor overflow check,
  `skillOverrides`, 1,536-char per-skill cap
- CI: doc-drift gate (`tests/doc-drift.sh`) - docs must match disk
- CI: skill behavioural test suites (`tests/run-skill-tests.sh`)

### Fixed
- `fleet.sh` `ensure_fleet_dir` returned 1 under `set -e` on every invocation
  after the first, silently killing post-init commands
- fleet-ops e2e suite asserted a worktree path `fleet.sh` no longer uses
  (now 29/29 against real behaviour)

### Changed
- **fleet-ops v2** - repositioned as landing discipline (queue, test gate,
  pre-land scrub, one-shot revert) on top of native agent teams / background
  agents, which now own the spawning half; no longer EXPERIMENTAL except the
  daemon
- **/save + /sync repositioned** - native auto-memory covers single-machine
  context; these commands' value is portable state: task restore,
  git-trackable, team-shareable, cross-machine
- supply-chain-defense description trimmed under the 1,536-char listing cap
- README/AGENTS.md/PLAN.md reconciled with actual inventory; ghost references
  removed (`rules/thinking.md`, `docs/DASH.md`)
- `tests/skills/functional/git-workflow.*` renamed to `git-cli-tools.*`
