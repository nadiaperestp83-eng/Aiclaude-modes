> *A comprehensive extension toolkit that transforms Claude Code into a specialized development powerhouse.*

**claude-mods** is a production-ready plugin that extends Claude Code with 89 specialized skills, 3 expert agents, 13 output styles, 11 hooks, and modern CLI tools designed for real-world development workflows. Whether you're debugging React hooks, optimizing PostgreSQL queries, or building production CLI applications, this toolkit equips Claude with the domain expertise and procedural knowledge to work at expert level across multiple technology stacks.

Built on the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) (an open standard backed by Anthropic, Vercel, Google, Microsoft, and 40+ agent platforms), claude-mods fills critical gaps in Claude Code's capabilities: persistent session state that survives across machines, on-demand expert knowledge for specialized domains, token-efficient modern CLI tools (10-100x faster than traditional alternatives), and proven workflow patterns for TDD, code review, and feature development. The toolkit implements Anthropic's [recommended patterns for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents), ensuring your development context never vanishes when sessions end.

From Python async patterns to Rust ownership models, from AWS Fargate deployments to Craft CMS development - claude-mods provides the specialized knowledge and tools that transform Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a domain expert who understands your stack, remembers your workflow, and ships production code.

**3 agents. 89 skills. 13 styles. 11 hooks. 7 rules. One install.**

## Recent Updates

**v3.0.0** (June 2026)
- **Skills-first restructure** - *Breaking:* the expert-agent layer was cut from 23 to 3. Per Anthropic's guidance, knowledge belongs in skills (progressive disclosure, single source of truth) and subagents are reserved for context isolation — so *all* domain-knowledge agents became `-ops` skills (the 11 language/framework experts → their twins; cypress/cloudflare/bash/craftcms/payloadcms/asus-router → new skills; claude-architect/aws-fargate folded into existing skills). The 3 remaining agents are pure isolation/worker roles: `git-agent` (background commits/PRs), `firecrawl-expert` (noisy multi-page scrapes), `project-organizer` (bulk restructure). Dispatching skills now route `general-purpose` agents that preload skill references.
- **`claude-code-ops` skill** - claude-code-debug/-headless/-hooks merged and rebuilt from current official docs: the 30-event hook catalog with per-event JSON contracts, today's SKILL.md frontmatter spec, headless/CLI reference, and extension-debugging decision trees.
- **Three new skills, doc-verified** - `claude-api-ops` (Messages API, tool use, prompt caching, structured outputs, Agent SDK), `playwright-ops` (selector hierarchy, fixtures, CI sharding, flake hunting), `terraform-ops` (state, modules, OIDC plan/apply, secrets).
- **Media stack** - `ffmpeg-ops` (probe-first ffmpeg/ffprobe: ~30-command cookbook, EDL-driven editing, `.cube` LUT grading, VMAF gates, loudnorm, Whisper prep) and `ytdlp-ops` (the yt-dlp acquisition layer feeding it: format doctrine, clip-at-download, incremental channel syncs), each shipping a §7 staleness verifier.
- **Live security guards, zero hand-wiring** - `config-change-guard.sh` scans Claude settings files for worm-persistence IOCs the moment they're edited; `worktree-guard.sh` mechanically enforces worktree boundaries. Plugin-level `hooks/hooks.json` auto-wires the security set on install.
- **Skill Resource Protocol** - one build standard for skill scripts and assets ([docs/SKILL-RESOURCE-PROTOCOL.md](docs/SKILL-RESOURCE-PROTOCOL.md)), headlined by the staleness-verifier pattern: offline checks gate PR CI, live drift checks run weekly without ever blocking a PR. Four verifiers ship with it.
- **fleet-ops v2** - repositioned as landing discipline (sequential queue, test-gated merge, pre-land scrub, one-shot revert, new `fleet track`) on top of native agent teams and background agents, which now own session spawning.
- **Docs that can't rot** - new `CHANGELOG.md`; a CI doc-drift gate fails the build when README counts diverge from disk or a link goes ghost; every skill's behavioural suite runs in CI; /save + /sync repositioned as portable, team-shareable state alongside native auto-memory.

**v2.10.0** (May 2026)
- 🕵️ **`prompt-injection-defense` skill** - Instruction-integrity sibling to `supply-chain-defense`: defends the agent's context surface against adversarial content where what a reviewer sees differs from what the model reads. `scan-hidden-unicode.py` detects bidi/Trojan-Source reordering, `U+E0000` tag-block ASCII smuggling, zero-width text, and (`--strict`) homoglyphs — emoji-whitelisted so it doesn't false-positive on every README; `sanitize-content.py` strips them from untrusted content before ingest (byte-faithful, idempotent). Deployed as silent guardians at the trust boundaries: a SessionStart hook scans project instruction files at boot, a git pre-commit gate blocks `critical` hidden Unicode from entering the repo, and `rules/prompt-injection.md` drives scan-on-entry / sanitize-on-ingest. Codepoint catalog + 2 references + 18-assertion offline suite.

**v2.9.0** (May 2026)
- 🛡️ **`supply-chain-defense` skill** - Behavioural-first defense against the 2026 npm/PyPI/Composer worm campaign (Shai-Hulud) that `npm audit` misses in the publish-to-advisory window — the proactive sibling to `security-ops`. Free-first Socket.dev integration (open-source CLI, zero-auth `depscore` MCP) plus advisory hooks on both install commands and manifest edits. `exposure-check.py` matches installed lockfiles (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun, PyPI, Composer, Cargo, Go, RubyGems + editor extensions) against a cited-IOC catalog; `integrity-audit.sh` hunts worm persistence in configs, shell rc, and `.npmrc`; `preinstall-check.sh` enforces a 7-day release-age cooldown. A global `rules/supply-chain.md` carries the doctrine everywhere; 42-assertion offline test suite, IOC format from Perplexity's [Bumblebee](https://github.com/perplexityai/bumblebee).

**v2.8.0** (May 2026)
- 🩺 **`mac-ops` skill** - Comprehensive macOS workstation diagnostics, peer to `windows-ops`. 23 scripts + 11 reference docs along an 8-rung ladder: `health-audit` orchestrates and `quickrun` gives a one-shot "what's wrong with my Mac?" verdict. Mac-unique probes cover TCC privacy permissions (the "can't screen-share" cause), wake reasons, Spotlight, and APFS storage pressure (the "disk full but `du` disagrees" mystery).

**v2.6.0** (May 2026)
- 🩺 **`windows-ops` skill** - Comprehensive Windows workstation diagnostics. Seven scripts + five reference catalogs: `health-audit` renders a state-grouped panel and maps `\Device\HarddiskN` → drive letter so a verdict names the actual failing drive; `crash-triage` decodes Event 41 BugCheck codes and walks the minutes before a crash for smoking guns; `recover-clone` wraps `robocopy /R:0` so retries don't hasten a dying drive's death.

**v2.5.0** (May 2026)
- 🌐 **`net-ops` skill** - Cross-platform network troubleshooting (Windows / macOS / Linux) via local or remote SSH with a layered diagnostic ladder: link → ICMP → socket → DNS infrastructure → OS resolver → app. NDP-aware IPv6 classifier (disabled / ULA-only / no-route / path-broken / healthy), MTU/PMTU test, time-skew check, browser DoH detection (Chrome / Brave / Firefox), WSL2/container awareness. Modes: `--watch`, `--json` (NDJSON), `--redact` for opsec-clean dumps, `--quick` for skip-if-healthy. Per-OS probe + dns-audit + repair scripts, reverse-mode probe, 24-test self-suite.
- 🌐 **`portless-ops` skill** - Local-dev HTTPS proxy operations for Vercel Labs' [portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless). Wraps the canonical upstream `SKILL.md` and `oauth/SKILL.md` (vendored verbatim into `references/` since the npm package only ships `dist/`) and overlays operational patterns we've validated: the static-alias pattern for pairing portless with external supervisors (Process Compose, PM2, Docker), TLD selection decision tree (`.test`/`.dev`/`.localhost`/custom-owned), Windows-specific gotchas (`openssl` PATH from Git for Windows, `certutil` quirks, curl-vs-browser cert handling, PS 5.1 vs 7+ flag differences), the clean-reset procedure when changing TLDs (because `portless alias --remove` appends the active TLD), and three runnable scripts: `install-portless.ps1` (audits the npm tarball for known supply-chain IOCs *before* installing), `reset-state.ps1` (full state wipe + re-register), `sync-aliases-from-yaml.ps1` (derives portless aliases from a supervisor's YAML). Four `portless.json` asset templates cover single-app, monorepo, custom-TLD-documented, and `package.json`-inline patterns.
- 🎛️ **`process-compose-ops` skill** - Comprehensive operations for [Process Compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose), the Go-binary supervisor replacing PM2/supervisord/Foreman for non-containerised local services. Six reference files: `schema-reference.md` (full YAML schema with field semantics, defaults, and command-quoting gotchas including Windows-PATH backslash handling), `probe-patterns.md` (readiness probe recipes per stack — Python/Go/Node/TCP-only/daemons), `dependency-patterns.md` (`depends_on` patterns: companion daemons, DB-before-app, tunnel-after-service, one-shot init), `tui-shortcuts.md` (TUI keybindings cheatsheet, status legend, search/sort), `boot-persistence-windows.md` (Task Scheduler with `S4U` logon and PATH-aware wrapper script), `supply-chain-verification.md` (SHA-256 verification procedure for the binary). Four runnable scripts: `install-process-compose.ps1` (verified download + extract + writes `VERIFICATION.md`), `verify-binary.ps1` (re-verifies committed binary hash), plus boot wrapper and Task Scheduler installer templates. Five YAML assets: Python service, Django+companions, Go binary, Cloudflare tunnel pattern, cron job. Material derived from a 3-hour production migration from PM2+Caddy+Dagu to Process Compose+portless, anonymised for general use.
- 📦 **Plugin manifest catch-up** - `summon` (v2.4.11) and `fleet-ops` (post-v2.4.11) were committed and listed in README but never added to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `components.skills` array, so they weren't being indexed by the plugin system. Both registered correctly now alongside the new pair.
- 🗑️ **`/canvas` command and `canvas-tui` package removed** - The canvas command was experimental, Warp-terminal-specific, and unused. Deletion removes the only npm runtime-dep surface in claude-mods (2,096-line lockfile + 17 TypeScript/React source files + 117-line bundled README), leaving the repo as markdown + bash only. Minor bump rather than patch because it removes a documented public API (`/canvas`). Co-developed in branch `claude/sad-almeida-20699c` by a sibling Opus 4.7 session and integrated into this release.

**v2.4.11** (May 2026)
- ✨ **`summon` skill** - Push Claude Desktop Code-tab sessions across accounts so they appear in the next account you switch to. Best run *before* switching — while still on your current near-limit account, push mid-flight sessions to the destination, then Logout/Login as the natural switch. Default is copy (sessions visible from both accounts); `--move` for lean cleanup. Hierarchical Account → Project → Session picker with global numbering, `--peek <id>` for transcript preview, `--list-accounts` inventory, recency aliases (`--1d/--3d/--7d/--all`), 8-hint rotating tip system. Output follows `docs/TERMINAL-DESIGN.md` (Terminal Panel Design System).

## Why claude-mods?

Claude Code is powerful out of the box, but it has gaps. This toolkit fills them:

- **Session continuity** — Tasks vanish when sessions end. We fix that with `/save` and `/sync`, implementing Anthropic's [recommended pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) for long-running agents.

- **Expert-level knowledge on demand** — 89 on-demand skills covering React, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, PostgreSQL, and more, plus 3 specialized agents reserved for genuine context-isolation/worker roles (git operations, web scraping, project reorganization). Skills-first: knowledge loads when relevant instead of living in heavyweight agent prompts.

- **Modern CLI tools** — Stop using `grep`, `find`, and `cat`. Our rules automatically prefer `ripgrep`, `fd`, `eza`, and `bat` — 10-100x faster and token-efficient.

- **Smart web fetching** — A fallback hierarchy that actually works: WebFetch → Jina Reader → Firecrawl. No more "I can't access that URL."

- **Workflow patterns** — TDD cycles, code review, feature development, debugging — all documented with Anthropic's best practices.

## Key Benefits

- **Persistent task state** — Pick up exactly where you left off, even across machines
- **Domain expertise** — Agents trained on framework docs, not just general knowledge
- **Token efficiency** — Modern CLI tools produce cleaner output, saving context window
- **Team sharing** — Git-trackable state files work across your whole team
- **Production-ready** — Validated test suite, proper plugin format, comprehensive docs
- **Extended thinking** — Built-in guidance for "think hard" and "ultrathink" triggers
- **Zero lock-in** — Standard Claude Code plugin format, toggle on/off anytime

## Installation

### Plugin Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add 0xDarkMatter/claude-mods

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install claude-mods@0xDarkMatter-claude-mods
```

This installs globally (available in all projects). Toggle on/off with `/plugin` menu.

### Script Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xDarkMatter/claude-mods.git
cd claude-mods
bash scripts/install.sh
```

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (Git Bash). A PowerShell alternative is also available at `scripts/install.ps1`.

The install scripts:
- Copy commands, skills, agents, rules, output styles to `~/.claude/`
- Clean up deprecated items (e.g., old `/conclave` command)
- Remove renamed skills (e.g., `-patterns` -> `-ops`)
- Handle command→skill migrations (won't create duplicates)
- Preserve any extra skills installed separately (e.g., project-specific skills)

### CLI Tools (Optional)

Install modern CLI tools (fd, rg, bat, etc.) for better performance:

```bash
# Windows (Admin PowerShell)
.\tools\install-windows.ps1

# Linux/macOS
./tools/install-unix.sh
```

## Skill Architecture

All skills comply with the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and follow a consistent structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Core workflow (< 500 lines)
├── scripts/              # Executable code (optional)
├── references/           # Documentation loaded as needed (optional)
└── assets/               # Output templates/files (optional)
```

**Progressive Loading:**
1. Metadata (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. SKILL.md body - Loaded when skill triggers (<5k words)
3. Bundled resources - Loaded only when Claude needs them

All skills have the complete directory structure, even if `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` are currently empty. This ensures consistency and makes it easy to add bundled resources later.

See [skill-creator](skills/skill-creator/) for the complete guide.

### Agents

> **Skills-first (v3.0):** language/framework expert agents (python-expert, react-expert, etc.) were
> deprecated in favour of their `-ops` skill twins — unique agent content was folded into the skills.
>
> **Why, per Anthropic's guidance:** skills and subagents solve different problems. A subagent's value is
> *context isolation* — it runs in a separate context window so a large, noisy investigation returns only its
> distilled result to the main thread. Skills are the home for *knowledge*: thanks to progressive disclosure
> they cost ~100 tokens (name + description) until they're relevant, then load their body and references on
> demand. A `python-expert` agent that only carried Python knowledge used none of the isolation benefit — it
> was a knowledge container paying a dispatch cost, and it duplicated the `python-*-ops` skills (5 of the 11
> retired agents had *no* content their skill twin lacked). Knowledge belongs in skills; subagents are reserved
> for delegation that needs its own context or model.
>
> Delegation stays where it earns its keep: dispatching skills (review, testgen, perf-ops, security-ops,
> explain) still route to `general-purpose` agents — but those agents now *preload the relevant skill* for
> their knowledge. Subagent = the isolation mechanism, skill = the knowledge it loads. The agents below remain
> because they have no skill twin (a distinct capability, or — like git-agent — a real background-worker role
> that uses the isolation boundary).
>
> The end state is clean: **every domain-knowledge agent is now a skill**, and the only agents left are the
> three whose value *is* the isolation mechanism — git-agent (a background worker), firecrawl-expert (large
> noisy scrapes), and project-organizer (bulk filesystem restructure).
>
> Sources: [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — progressive disclosure and on-demand
> loading; [Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) — a separate context window for delegated work.

#### Web Fetching Hierarchy

When fetching web content, tools are used in this order:

| Priority | Tool | When to Use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `WebFetch` | First attempt - fast, built-in |
| 2 | `r.jina.ai/URL` | JS-rendered pages, PDFs, cleaner extraction |
| 3 | `firecrawl <url>` | Anti-bot bypass, blocked sites (403, Cloudflare) |
| 4 | `firecrawl-expert` agent | Complex scraping, structured extraction |

See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for full documentation and install scripts.

## Testing & Validation

Validate all extensions before committing:

```bash
cd tests

# Run full validation (requires just)
just test

# Or run directly
bash validate.sh

# Windows
powershell validate.ps1
```

### What's Validated
- YAML frontmatter syntax
- Required fields (name, description)
- Naming conventions (kebab-case)
- File structure (agents/*.md, skills/*/SKILL.md)
- Plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`) via the authoritative `claude plugin validate`, plus a guard against a stray root `marketplace.json`

### Available Tasks

```bash
cd tests
just              # List all tasks
just test         # Run full validation
just validate-yaml # YAML only
just validate-names # Naming only
just stats        # Count extensions
just list-agents  # List all agents
```

## Session Continuity

The `/save` and `/sync` commands make session state **portable**.

**What's native now:** Claude Code remembers a lot on its own. `--resume` and the session picker restore conversation history, auto-memory writes a per-project `MEMORY.md` with learnings Claude decides are worth keeping, and `/rewind` checkpoints let you roll back within a session. All of it is machine-local — per the docs, auto-memory files "are not shared across machines or cloud environments" — and it remembers context *for you*, in a format Claude curates.

**What's still missing:** task state. Tasks (created via TaskCreate, managed via TaskList/TaskUpdate) are session-scoped and deleted when the session ends — by design. And none of the native state is something you can commit, review, or hand to a teammate.

**What `/save` + `/sync` add:** a state file you control — task restore, structured git/PR context, explicit human-readable handoff notes, and session-ID bridging. Because it lives in your repo, it's git-trackable, team-shareable, and follows you across machines. This implements the pattern from Anthropic's [Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents):

> "Every subsequent session asks the model to make incremental progress, then leave structured updates."

### What Persists vs What Doesn't

| Claude Code Feature | Persists? | Scope |
|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| Conversation history | Yes | This machine (`--resume` / session picker) |
| Auto-memory (MEMORY.md) | Yes | This machine, per repo — Claude-curated learnings, not task state |
| CLAUDE.md context | Yes | Wherever you commit it |
| Tasks | **No** | Deleted on session end |
| Plan Mode state | **No** | In-memory only |

### Session Workflow

```
Session 1:
  /sync                              # Bootstrap + restore saved state
  [work on tasks]
  /save "Stopped at auth module"     # Writes session-cache.json + MEMORY.md

Session 2:
  [MEMORY.md auto-loaded: "Goal: Auth, Branch: feature/auth, PR: #42"]
  /sync                              # Full restore: tasks, plan, git, PR
  → "Previous session: abc123... (claude --resume abc123...)"
  → "In progress: Auth module refactor"
  → "PR: #42 (claude --from-pr 42)"
```

### Why Not Just Use `--resume` or Auto-Memory?

| Feature | `--resume` | Auto-memory | `/save` + `/sync` |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conversation history | Yes | No | No |
| Learnings/preferences | No | Yes (Claude-curated) | No |
| Tasks | **No** | **No** | Yes |
| Git/PR context | PR only (`--from-pr`) | Incidental | Yes (structured, `gh`-detected) |
| Session ID bridging | N/A | No | Yes (suggests `--resume <id>`) |
| Explicit handoff notes | No | No | Yes |
| Git-trackable | No | No | Yes |
| Works across machines | No | No (machine-local) | Yes (if committed) |
| Team sharing | No | No | Yes |

**Use all three together:** `claude --resume` for conversation context, auto-memory for accumulated learnings, `/sync` for task state and handoff. Since v3.1, `/save` stores your session ID so `/sync` can suggest the exact `--resume` command.

### Session Cache Schema (v3.1)

The `.claude/session-cache.json` file stores full task objects:

```json
{
  "version": "3.1",
  "session_id": "977c26c9-60fa-4afc-a628-a68f8043b1ab",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "subject": "Task title",
      "description": "Detailed description",
      "activeForm": "Working on task",
      "status": "completed|in_progress|pending",
      "blockedBy": [0, 1]
    }
  ],
  "plan": { "file": "docs/PLAN.md", "goal": "...", "current_step": "...", "progress_percent": 40 },
  "git": { "branch": "main", "last_commit": "abc123", "pr_number": 42, "pr_url": "https://..." },
  "memory": { "synced": true },
  "notes": "Session notes"
}
```

**Compatibility:** `/sync` handles both v3.0 and v3.1 files gracefully. Missing v3.1 fields are treated as absent.

## Updating

```bash
git pull
```

Then re-run the install script to update your global Claude configuration.

## Performance Tips

### MCP Tool Search

When using multiple MCP servers (Chrome DevTools, Vibe Kanban, etc.), their tool definitions consume context. Enable Tool Search to load tools on-demand:

```json
// .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "env": {
    "ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH": "true"
  }
}
```

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `"auto"` | Enable when MCP tools > 10% of context (default) |
| `"auto:5"` | Custom threshold (5%) |
| `"true"` | Always enabled (recommended) |
| `"false"` | Disabled |

**Requirements:** Sonnet 4+ or Opus 4+ (Haiku not supported)

### Skill Description Budget

With 80+ skills installed (this plugin alone ships 81), skill descriptions can overflow the listing budget. All skill names are always listed, but descriptions share a budget of **1% of the model context window** — on overflow, least-invoked skills lose their descriptions first and **silently stop auto-triggering** (explicit `/name` invocation still works). Each skill's combined `description` + `when_to_use` is also truncated at **1,536 chars**, so trigger phrases belong at the front.

- **Check:** run `/doctor` — it shows whether the budget is overflowing and which skills are affected.
- **Fix:** demote or disable skills you don't use via `skillOverrides` in settings (`"on"` / `"name-only"` / `"user-invocable-only"` / `"off"` per skill, or `/skills` + `Space`). Plugin skills are managed via `/plugin` instead.
- **Or raise the budget:** `skillListingBudgetFraction` setting (e.g. `0.02`), `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var for a fixed char count, or `maxSkillDescriptionChars` for the per-skill cap.

### Skills Over Commands

Most functionality lives in skills rather than commands. Skills get slash-hint discovery via trigger keywords and load on-demand, reducing context overhead. Only session management (`/sync`, `/save`) remains as commands.

See `docs/COMMAND-SKILL-PATTERN.md` for details.
